## [Version 1.2.0](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.cpp/compare/v1.1..v1.2.0) - (2020-12-27)

This release bring in some missing MQTT v5 features, brings in support for websocket headers and proxies, ALPN protocol lists, adds the builder pattern for options, and fixes a number of bugs in both the C++ library and the underlying C lib.

Requires Paho C v1.3.8

- Missing MQTT v5 features:
    - Ability to add properties to Subscribe and Unsubscribe packets (i.e. subscription identifiers)
    - "Disconnected" callback gives reason code and properties for server disconnect
- New `create_options` that can be used to construct a client with new features:
    - Send while disconnected before the 1st successful connection
    - Output buffer can delete oldest messages when full
    - Can choose to clear the persistence store on startup
    - Select whether to persist QoS 0 messages
- Started classes to create options using the Builder Pattern, with the `create_options_builder`, `connect_options_builder`, `message_ptr_builder`, etc.
- User-defined websocket HTTP headers.
- HTTP/S proxy support
- Added ALPN protocol support to SSL/TLS options
- SSL/TLS error and PSK callback support
- Update connection callback support (change credentials when using auto-reconnect)
- Updates to the sample apps:
    - Overall cleanup with better consistency
    - Example of using websockets and a proxy
    - User-based file persistence with simple encoding/encryption
    - Sharing a client between multiple threads
- Converted the unit tests to use Catch2
- All library exceptions are now properly derived from the `mqtt::exception` base class.
- [#231] Added `on_disconnected` callback to handle receipt of disconnect packet from server.
- [#211, #223, #235] Removed use of Log() function from the Paho C library.
- [#227] Fixed race condition in thread-safe queue
- [#224] & [#255] Subscribing to MQTT v3 broker with array of one topic causes segfault.
- [#282] Ability to build Debian/Ubuntu package
- [#300] Calling `reconnect()` was hanging forever, even when successful. In addition several of the synchronous `client` calls were hanging forever on failure. They now properly throw a `timeout_error` exception.
- Several memory issues and bug fixes from updated Paho C library support.


## Version 1.1 (2019-10-12)

This release was primarily to add MQTT v5 support and server responses.

- MQTT v5 support:
    - **Properties**
        - New `property` class acts something like a std::variant to hold a property of any supported type.
        - New `properties` class is a collection type to hold all the properties for a single transmitted packet.
        - Properties can be added to outbound messages and obtained from received messages.
        - Properties can also be obtained from server responses to requests such as from a _connect_ call. These are available in the `token` objects when they complete.
    - The client object tracks the desired MQTT version that the app requested and/or is currently connected at. Internally this is now required by the `response_options` the need to distinguish between pre-v5 and post-v5 callback functions.
    - MQTT v5 reason codes for requests are available via `token` objects when they complete. They are also available in `exception` objects that are thrown by tokens.
    - Support for subscibe options, like no local subscriptions, etc.
    - Sample applications were added showing how to do basic Remote Procedure Calls (RPC's) with MQTT v5 using the *RESPONSE_TOPIC* and *CORRELATION_DATA* properties. These are *rpc_math_cli* and *rpc_math_srvr* in the _src/samples_ directory.
    - A sample "chat" application was added, showing how to use subscribe options, such as "no local".
- More descriptive error messages (PR #154), integrated into the `mqtt::exception` class. MQTT v5 reason codes are also included in the exceptions when an error occurs.
- Applications can (finally) get server responses from the various ACK packets. These are available through the tokens after they complete, as `connect_response`, `subscribe_response`, and `unsubscribe_response`.
- The `topic` objects can be used to subscribe.
- Applications can register individual callback functions instead of using a `callback` interface object. This allows easy use of lambda functions for callbacks.
- The connect options can take a LWT as a plain message, via `connect_options::set_will_message()` 
- New unit tests have started using _Catch2_.
- Tested with Paho C v1.3.1

- Fixed a number of build issues, particularly on Windows
- Windows shared libraries (DLL's) now supported
- Several minor bug fixes


##  Version 1.0.0 (2017-07-23)

The initial Paho C++ Client library for memory-managed platforms (Linux, Windows, etc).

- Requires Paho C Client Library v1.2.
- MQTT 3.1 & 3.1.1 
- SSL/TLS
- Asynchronous & Synchronous interfaces
- Persistence and off-line buffering
- Automatic reconnect
- High availability.
